[![Lookbook UI](.github/assets/lookbook_ui.png)](http://lookbook.build/)

## Development

Lookbook is implemented as an isolated [Rails Engine](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) and uses [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/) for its UI.

This repository contains:

* The Lookbook source code ([`/app`](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook/tree/main/app), [`/lib`](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook/tree/main/lib), [`/config`](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook/tree/main/config), etc)
* The Lookbook [documentation site](#docs-site) source code and content ([`/docs`](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook/tree/main/docs)).
* A [test suite](#testing) with a 'runable' dummy app ([`/spec`](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/lookbook/tree/main/spec)).

### Documentation site

The [Lookbook docs site](https://lookbook.build) is built using [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) and the source files can be found in the `./docs` directory.

To preview changes locally you can run a development version of the docs site:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Start the app: `bin/docs`
4. Visit http://localhost:4000 

### Experimental features opt-in

Lookbook occasionally has one or more experimental/beta/work-in-progress features that are made available for testing before they are released (or abandoned!).

You can add the name of any experimental feature you wish to opt-in to into the `config.lookbook.experimental_features` array:

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.lookbook.experimental_features << :the_feature_name
```

#### Available features

_There are currently no experimental features available._

### Testing

Lookbook uses [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec). [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) is used to run tests against different Ruby and Rails versions.

Tests can be run using the `bundle exec appraisal rspec` command.

The dummy app that the tests are being run against can be viewed by running the `bin/dummy` command and then browsing to http://localhost:9292/lookbook

### Releases

Lookbook uses [Release It!](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to automate the release process.

Running `npm run release` will start the process of publishing a new release and walks though all the steps from picking a version number to publishing the updated gem.

Publishing a release requires write permissions for this repository (lookbook-hq/lookbook) and 2FA publish permissions for Lookbook on RubyGems.
